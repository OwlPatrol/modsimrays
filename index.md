# Ray Tracing!
Ray tracing is, simply put, a technique used for modelling how light travels commonly used in rendering of digital images. It is usually used in order to render realistic lighting on 3D models. There exists a wide variety of ray-tracing based rendering techniques that vary in the degree of accuracy and realism. There is usually a trade-off between the detail, thereby accuracy, of the simulation and the computational power required. Therefore, different algorithms are used case by case depending what aspect is prioritised. 

# Our Project, and the purpose of this blog
This blog is meant to track our progress as we work on the modsim project. The initial state of this blog is a bit shorthand, but we simply forgot a blog was required up until 5 hours before the deadline to turn in a project specification, so it will hopefully be improved over time.
What exactly are we intending on doing?

We are intending to simulate light through implementation of a ray tracer. Ideally we're looking to be able to have a final product where we can show a small environment interacting with light sources coming from different directions and distances, for example through making a small sunrise, sunset cycle.
